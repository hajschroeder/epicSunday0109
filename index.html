    <h3>A Brief History</h3>
    <p class="about">
      The Shire was first settled by hobbits in the year 1601 of the Third Age, but by our reckoning we'd call it Year 1. Despite the toils and trifles of the men and elves living beyond our borders, we've managed to keep our little corner of Middle Earth peaceful and quiet <span class="important"> (and we'd like to keep it that way, thankyouverymuch)</span>. All who can preserve the peace are welcome here! <a href= "contact.html">Let us know if you'd like to visit!!!</a>
