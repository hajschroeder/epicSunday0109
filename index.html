    <h2>Here Are Some Things We Like About Sundays</h2>
    <p>Sundays are pretty cool, a real stone groove! They're meant for relaxing, having fun, and doin' all the rad stuff you can't do during the week. Definitely shouldn't be spent sitting at the computer all day. Here's some things we like to do that aren't just sitting at the computer</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Going for a hike</li>
      <li>Reading books</li>
      <li>Watching some movies</li>
      <li>Playing with my dog</li>
      <li>Going to the park</li>
      <li>Catching up with family over the phone</li>
      <li>Cooking an elaborate meal</li>
    </ul>
